# Gonzalo Berhouet

I am a recently graduated software developer with a strong set of finance and commercial skills.

I completed the Makers Academy Bootcamp to gain more knowledge on what I would really like to be working on which is being a software developer.

I worked on different languages with more emphasis in Javascript and Ruby.

Previously, I worked as a Senior Financial Analyst at Dyer Baade & Company M&A consulting firm in which I worked with financial datasets and models.

I am confident that my previous experience is a highly valuable asset to build my technical knowledge as a software developer.
