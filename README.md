# Gonzalo Berhouet

I am a recently graduated software developer with a strong set of finance and commercial skills.

I completed the Makers Academy Bootcamp to gain more knowledge on what I would really like to be working on which is being a software developer.

I worked on different languages with more emphasis in Javascript and Ruby.

Previously, I worked as a Senior Financial Analyst at Dyer Baade & Company M&A consulting firm in which I worked with financial datasets and models.

I am confident that my previous experience is a highly valuable asset to build my technical knowledge as a software developer.

## Skills

#### Curiosity

I started being fascinated about programming 5 years ago when I was doing eDx Data science on python courses.
These courses were really an eye opener to me as I discovered how vast and interesting the coding world is.

#### Team player

My experience have demostrated me that when working in a team increases the commitment of each team member with the team's objective. As a consequence, team's output will be higher quality and with fewer errors. I also have ability, when necessary, to stepback in order to evaluate the different alternatives that my team-mates are proposing.
